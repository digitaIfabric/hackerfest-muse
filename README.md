#  Muse Tools use Open Sound Control (OSC) to pass data around. OSC is a simple protocol for sending data over a network. It was originally intended as a successor to MIDI, the well-known protocol for controlling electronic instruments, but it turns out to be really useful for all sorts of things, including Muse data.
